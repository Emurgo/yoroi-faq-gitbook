## What is Yoroi?

Yoroi is a web light wallet for Cardano. Light wallets don't need to download or synchronize the blockchain. This means that once you open the wallet, you can send or verify the reception of transactions right away.

Another more technical explanation would be that: Yoroi is light, hierarchical deterministic \(HD\) wallet for Ada \(cryptocurrency\), running as a Chrome extension.

## What is the difference between Daedalus and Yoroi?

Yoroi is a light wallet, which means it does not download the full copy of the blockchain. It connects to trusted servers which have the full copy of the blockchain. Daedalus is a full-node wallet which means that it downloads, stores and validates the full copy of the blockchain so it can operate in a trustless manner and it does not rely on centrally hosted servers.
