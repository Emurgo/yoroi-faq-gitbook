# General

## What is Yoroi?

Yoroi is a web light wallet for Cardano. Light wallets don't need to download or synchronize the blockchain. This means that once you open the wallet, you can send or verify the reception of transactions right away.

Another more technical explanation would be that: Yoroi is light, hierarchical deterministic \(HD\) wallet for Ada \(cryptocurrency\), running as a Chrome extension.

## What is the difference between Daedalus and Yoroi?

Yoroi is a light wallet, which means it does not download the full copy of the blockchain. It connects to trusted servers which have the full copy of the blockchain. Daedalus is a full-node wallet which means that it downloads, stores and validates the full copy of the blockchain so it can operate in a trustless manner and it does not rely on centrally hosted servers.

## What hardware supports Yoroi?

Any hardware that supports Google Chrome and Extensions. This means that you can use Yoroi in Linux, Mac OS, Windows, among others, but not in iOS or Android.

## How do I download Yoroi?

Yoroi can be found and installed through the Chrome Store, Firefox Store, AppStore and Google Play. Links here https://yoroi-wallet.com/#/

## Can I run Yoroi on 2 different computers?

Yes, as long as you don't have both instances open at the same time (keeping both open could cause desyncing issues).

## How do I log out of the Yoroi wallet?

There is no function to log out of the Yoroi Chrome extension. You can simply close the tab to exit. Note that your spending password is required in order to send ada from Yoroi, so nobody else can transfer your ada without your password.

## How do I uninstall Yoroi?
Simply remove the plugin from Chrome in the Extensions section. 

Warning: This will remove the private key and all storage associated with the wallet. We highly recommend that if you want to access the wallet in the future, you have a backup of the mnemonics words.

## Will staking be available in Yoroi?
Yoroi supports staking through delegation in all of its versions (desktop and mobile).
