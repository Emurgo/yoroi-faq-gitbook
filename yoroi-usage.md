# Uso de Yoroi

## How do I send and receive ADA using Yoroi?

In order to receive Ada using Yoroi you first need to create your wallet in Yoroi. Be careful to store your 15-word recovery phrase for your wallet which you will get during the wallet creation process. This is very important, if you lose this you will likely lose your Ada.

To receive Ada go to the Receive tab in your wallet and generate an address. Use a button in the user interface to copy it to the clipboard and then share it with the person who is going to send you Ada.

To send Ada, obtain a Yoroi address from the person you are going to send Ada to and use the Send tab in your wallet to send the desired amount of Ada to that address.

## Once I have downloaded Yoroi, how long before I can send and receive ADA?

Once you have downloaded Yoroi, you will need to create and backup your wallet which takes a couple of minutes. As soon as your wallet is created and your 15-word Yoroi Recovery Phrase is safely backed up, you will be able to send and receive Ada instantly since there is no need to wait for blockchain synchronization.
